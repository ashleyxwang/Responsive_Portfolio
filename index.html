        <p class="Description">
            Designer, developer, carpenter, painter, artisan.
            <br>
            Ashley has a passion for fabrication whether she is using code, power tools, or paint brushes. She is not afraid to experiment and be challenged with unusual ideas.
            <br>
            As a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, some skillsets she developed from this program are in: graphic design, merchandising, layout design, and marketing. 
            After deciding to take her skills into the world of theater, she decided to pursue Scenic Design at The Theatre School at DePaul University in Chicago.
            Here she is developing hard skills in set design, props artistry, and carpentry. 
            While completing this degree, her curiosity for coding and web development inspired her to enroll in a 6 month Web Development bootcamp with Northwestern University.
            She has worked at the Williamstown Theatre Festival, the Santa Fe Opera, and will be graduating in June of 2019.
